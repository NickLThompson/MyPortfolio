## Description

This was our first real assignment. It is a personal website

portfolio that includes my name, a quick about me, 

links to my portfolio (github), LinkedIn, and my contact

information. 

## Usage

The usage for this assignment is to become very familiar 

with HTML and CSS while also both completing our assignment

and creating a real portfolio for ourselves.
