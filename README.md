## Description

This was our first real assignment. It is a personal website

portfolio that includes my name, a quick about me, 

links to my portfolio (github), LinkedIn, and my contact

information. 

## Usage

The usage for this assignment is to become very familiar 

with HTML and CSS while also both completing our assignment

and creating a real portfolio for ourselves.

## Roadmap

My roadmap for this project is to keep working as hard as I

have been on it and not stopping. I worked very hard on this

and just because it's quality is poor doesn't mean it can't 

be improved.


## Status

The status of this project is a very poor one. I worked

for 18+ hours in total on this single project and to see

it turn out so badly is incredibly disheartening. I really

gave it my all and I still didn't get it all the way right.

I really don't know why this was such a struggle. It seems

like such an easy thing to everyone else. I hope to not only

improve this project, but to alos look back and laugh on this

read me status.
